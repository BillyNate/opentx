Configuration for the Heltek WiFi Kit 32 board with OLED display.

This board has all ADC1 pin broken out so the battery voltage is valid also when WIFi is on.
It uses just one MCP23017 I2C 16 IO port extendeer limiting functionality somewhat: no rotray encoder and no TRN and GEAR switch inputs.

The configuration was checked only on proto board. Use it on your own risk.
